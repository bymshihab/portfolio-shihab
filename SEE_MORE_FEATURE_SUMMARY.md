# See More/See Less Feature Implementation

## âœ… What's Been Added:

### 1. **Component Logic** (`activity.component.ts`)
- `showAllActivities: boolean` - Controls whether all activities are displayed
- `INITIAL_DISPLAY_COUNT = 5` - Constant defining how many activities to show initially
- `displayedActivities` getter - Returns either first 5 or all activities based on state
- `shouldShowSeeMore` getter - Shows "See More" button when there are >5 activities and not all are shown
- `shouldShowSeeLess` getter - Shows "See Less" button when all activities are shown
- `toggleShowAll()` method - Toggles between showing all and showing limited activities

### 2. **Template Updates** (`activity.component.html`)
- Changed `*ngFor="let activity of activities"` to `*ngFor="let activity of displayedActivities"`
- Added "See More/See Less" button with:
  - Dynamic text showing count of hidden activities
  - Animated icons (down arrow for "See More", up arrow for "See Less")
  - Smooth hover effects and transitions
- Added activity count badge in the header
- Enhanced styling with CSS classes

### 3. **Styling** (`activity.component.css`)
- `fadeInUp` animation for smooth activity appearance
- Button hover effects with elevation
- Enhanced loading spinner animation
- Transition effects for better user experience

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works:

1. **Initial Load**: Shows only first 5 activities
2. **When >5 activities exist**: "See More" button appears with count (e.g., "Show 3 more activities")
3. **Click "See More"**: Expands to show all activities, button changes to "See Less"
4. **Click "See Less"**: Collapses back to first 5 activities
5. **Refresh**: Resets to initial state (first 5 activities)

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Features:

- **Activity Count Badge**: Shows total number of activities next to the header
- **Animated Icons**: Down/up arrows that animate on hover
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade-in animations for new activities
- **Hover Effects**: Button elevation and color changes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## ðŸ”§ Customization Options:

### Change Initial Display Count:
```typescript
readonly INITIAL_DISPLAY_COUNT = 3; // Show only 3 initially
```

### Modify Button Text:
```html
Show {{ activities.length - INITIAL_DISPLAY_COUNT }} more activities
<!-- Change to: -->
Load {{ activities.length - INITIAL_DISPLAY_COUNT }} more
```

### Adjust Animations:
```css
/* Faster animation */
.activity-item {
  animation: fadeInUp 0.2s ease-out;
}

/* Different animation */
@keyframes slideIn {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateX(-20px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateX(0); }
}
```

## ðŸ“± Usage:

The feature automatically activates when you have more than 5 activities. You can test it by:

1. Adding more manual activities in the service
2. Configuring Medium integration to fetch more articles
3. The button will only appear when needed

## ðŸš€ Benefits:

- **Better Performance**: Only renders visible activities initially
- **Improved UX**: Cleaner interface with expandable content
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Users can choose to see more content
- **Mobile Friendly**: Reduces scroll length on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Clear button labels and keyboard navigation
